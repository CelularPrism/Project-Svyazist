Well, private Krutikov, excellent student, huh? Well, here's your first field training task: avoiding detection, #speaker:Political instructor
 move the transmitter to a hill and transmit your coordinates to the training headquarters using Morse code.
Do not forget to take a bayonet knife in addition to the receiver. Just don't try to throw yourself at the enemy with him, this task is not for a signalman. 

That's right, Comrade Semyonov! I accept the task! #speaker:Vladimir
