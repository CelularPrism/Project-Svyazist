Private Krutikov, I know that you have just returned from a mission and are tired, but there is no one else besides you. #speaker:Chief of Staff
Our squad was surrounded, we need to establish communication and help our fighters get out. 
It's not that simple there, the fields are already mined, so Sergeant Petrov will help you, he will make the task easier.
I will try to cope. For the Soviet Union!#speaker:Vladimir
