Yes, the task is not pleasant. Ours had mined the field just the day before to cover the retreat. And now they you must go right through it #speaker:Sergeant Petrov

It’s okay, I think we can handle it. Just look at the assistant we have! #speaker:Vladimir

You’re right, it's Pluto - a smart and loyal dog. An excellent professional in his field, the mines should not be a problem with him, unless of course you rush ahead of him#speaker:Sergeant Petrov

Then let's hurry, time is not on our side#speaker:Vladimir
